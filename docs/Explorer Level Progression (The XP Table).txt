Explorer Level Progression (The XP Table)


This table defines the cumulative XP required to achieve each Explorer Level and specifies the major feature unlocks that reward the user for their progress. This structure will be accessed by the On-Chain Verification Service to determine level-ups after a mission is completed.

Integration Logic for the Verification Service


When the On-Chain Verification Service successfully confirms a mission and calculates the new totalXP, it follows this logic:
1. Read: Fetch the user's current explorerLevel (e.g., 3) and totalXP (e.g., 1,800).
2. Compare: Loop through the XP Table, starting from the user's current level, until the new totalXP exceeds the Cumulative XP Required for the next level.
   * Example: User at 1,800 XP completes a 500 XP mission, bringing total to 2,300 XP. This exceeds the Level 4 requirement of 2,250 XP.
3. Update: Update the user's Firestore document:
   * Set explorerLevel to 4.
   * Trigger a frontend Level Up Animation/Notification to celebrate the unlock.
4. Access Control: The frontend relies on this explorerLevel to dynamically enable access to locked expeditions and features like the Leaderboard.
This table provides the developer with all the necessary constants to manage user progression and feature gating.
